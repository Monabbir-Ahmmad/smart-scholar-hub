/**
 * Dashboard Services
 * 
 * This module provides services for dashboard data retrieval.
 * Currently using mock data with Mongoose query comments for backend reference.
 * 
 * To switch to real backend:
 * 1. Create actual API endpoints using the Mongoose queries documented in each mock service
 * 2. Update the imports in this file to use API client functions instead of mocks
 * 
 * Schema reference: See SCHEMA_SUMMARY.md for complete MongoDB schema documentation

// Export all mock services

// Export types
